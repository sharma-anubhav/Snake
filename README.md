# Snake
Who needs a nokia just to enjoy a classic old school snake whe you can code it yourself and make it a rather learning experience (before wasting time playing it).<br>
While most of the people use an array for implementing this particular game, i was new to linked list and its visualisation kind of looked like a snake hence i got the idea to code this game in the first place.
